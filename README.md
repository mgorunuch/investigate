A comprehensive OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) investigation platform designed for security researchers and analysts to organize, analyze, and visualize intelligence data from multiple sources.

## üéØ Purpose

Streamline OSINT workflows by providing unified data collection, analysis, and reporting capabilities for cybersecurity investigations and threat intelligence research.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Investigation Management
- Create and manage investigation cases with defined targets and objectives
- Track investigation progress and timelines
- Multi-analyst collaboration with role-based access control

### Data Collection & Integration
- **Certificate Transparency**: CT log analysis and monitoring
- **Domain Intelligence**: Subdomain enumeration, DNS analysis  
- **Social Media**: Profile analysis, digital footprint mapping
- **Infrastructure**: IP analysis, hosting relationships
- **Document Intelligence**: Metadata extraction, content analysis

### Analysis & Visualization
- Entity relationship mapping with interactive network graphs
- Timeline analysis for chronological intelligence visualization
- Cross-source data correlation and validation
- Confidence scoring for intelligence assessments

### Reporting & Export
- Generate comprehensive investigation reports
- Export data in multiple formats (PDF, CSV, JSON)
- Source attribution and audit trails
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ or Bun runtime
- PostgreSQL 14+ (for production)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mgorunuch/investigate.git
   cd investigate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üõ† Development Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bun run dev` | Start development server |
| `bun run build` | Build for production |
| `bun run start` | Start production server |
| `bun run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `bun run type-check` | Run TypeScript type checking |

## üèó Architecture

### Investigation-Centric Design
The platform is built around **investigation cases** where analysts collect, organize, and analyze intelligence data.

### API Structure
Every API endpoint follows a strict 3-file structure:
```
/src/app/api/[endpoint]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ route.ts      # Server-side API handler
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contracts.ts  # Zod schemas & TypeScript types  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ clients.ts    # Client-side functions
```

### Key Components
- **Cases**: Individual investigations with specific targets and objectives
- **Entities**: People, organizations, domains, IPs, certificates
- **Relationships**: Connections between entities with source attribution
- **Timeline Events**: Chronological intelligence data points
- **Sources**: OSINT data sources with reliability scoring

## üîß Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (production)
- **Validation**: Zod
- **Charts**: Recharts, D3.js
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js (future)

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Standard Deployment
```bash
# Build for production
bun run build

# Start production server
bun run start
```

## üîê Security Features

- **Data Sanitization**: All imported intelligence data is sanitized
- **Source Verification**: Automated checks for source authenticity
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all operations
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to sensitive investigations
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies

## üìä OSINT Integration

### Supported Sources
- Certificate Transparency logs
- Domain registration data
- Social media platforms
- Infrastructure databases
- Public document repositories

### Data Standards
- **Source Attribution**: Every data point includes source metadata
- **Entity Management**: Standardized schemas for all intelligence entities
- **Relationship Modeling**: Explicit connections between entities
- **Confidence Scoring**: All assessments include confidence levels
